sqaod (0.2.0-0~xenial) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Beta 1. Version 0.2.0
    Interfaces for the python package and c++ solver interfaces have been fixed.

  * Operators for MatrixType<> and VectorType<> are delegated to Eigen.
    Eigen usage is wrapped in libsqaodc-<simd> packages.

  * SQAOD_VERBOSE env var is introduced to control log output.
    Setting SQAOD_VERBOSE as non '0' value to enable log output, otherwise logs are suppressed.

  * set_qset() is introduced to set an array of bit vectors to annealers.
    In alpha2, set_q() was previously able to accepat a bit vector and an array of bit vectors.  In beta1, set_q() is to set a bit vector, and newly-introduced set_qset() is to set an array of bit vectors.

  * sqaod.cuda.formulas has been enabled.

  * Stride is introduced to MatrixType<> and DeviceMatrixType<> to enable further optimizataion.

  * More tests and fixes
    Fixed: FP32 solvers did not work.
    Tests are refined and updated.

  * change in API.
    set_x() -> set_q().
    set_q() accepts vector and vector array.
